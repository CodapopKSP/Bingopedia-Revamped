When clicking a link, it doesn't start loading the new article right away, so it isn't clear if the link click registered
Sometimes clicks get ignored, and I think it's because the website seems to refresh every second. The links flash every second when you hover them.
Going to the same article twice in a row shouldn't count a click and shouldn't show up in the history
Needs table of contents in the article viewer to quickly jump sections. Should be the same ToC as Wikipedia.
If an article fails to load in the viewer, it should try again
