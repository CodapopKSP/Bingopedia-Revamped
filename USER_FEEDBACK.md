# User Feedback

This is an unorganized list of feedback from users after the previous sprint. It contains both bug reports as well as feature requests.

1. The Table of Contents appears to be broken. Sometimes nothing loads. Sometimes it loads seemingly incorrect data. But no matter what it doesn't actually scroll the page. It needs to show the right section headers and scroll to the right place.

2. Images in the article viewer shoudln't have the mouse pointer hand. Just be the normal pointer.

3. The game review modal from the leaderboard should be 15% longer. The bingo board in that view can also be 15% larger.

4. In mobile view, the leaderboard game review modal shows the article history on top of the bingo board, obscuring the board. It should only be visible when the tab is selected.

5. Titles of articles in the viewer in mobile view are very poorly handled. The ToC and View on Wiki buttons take up a lot of horizontal space. They can be much smaller (ToC can be a hamburger menu icon) and the titles can have better handling.
