# User Feedback

This is an unorganized list of feedback from users after the previous sprint. It contains both bug reports as well as feature requests.

1. Table of Contents takes forever to load. Like there's a 2-3 second delay from clicking it to when it opens.

2. Table of Contents doesn't work. The table is always just "v", "t", and "e". Clicking them does nothing.

3. I clicked one of the pictures in an article and it tried to load the SVG. This shouldn't happen.

4. The (paused) text next to the timer is distracting. Instead we should put text under "Loading article..." that says something about the timer being paused.

5. In the leaderboard when viewing a previous game, the Bingo board view is too short. Only the top 2 rows are visible on the screen. This modal should be increased in height, the board itself should shrink a bit, the width of the modal should slim down a bit, and the article history tab should not be smaller than the bingo board tab (right now they're the same but I'm worried that won't be the case if we increase the height of the modal).
