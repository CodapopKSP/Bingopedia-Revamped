# Documentation Archive Summary

This archive contains documentation from the Bingopedia rebuild project that tracked implementation work. All items in this folder are **completed** and no longer need to be actively maintained.

## What Was Archived

### Implementation Checklists (Completed)
- **ENGINEERING_CHECKLIST.md** - Complete engineering implementation checklist
- **FRONTEND_TASKS.md** - Frontend implementation tasks (all completed)
- **BACKEND_TASKS.md** - Backend implementation tasks (all completed)
- **UI_UX_TASKS.md** - UI/UX implementation tasks (all completed)

### Bug Fixes (Completed)
- **FRONTEND_BUG_FIXES.md** - Frontend bug fixes (all resolved)
- **BUG_FIXES_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of all bug fixes

### UI Documentation (Completed)
- **UI_DESIGN.md** - UI design documentation
- **UI_STRUCTURE.md** - UI component structure
- **UI_POLISH_CHECKLIST.md** - UI polish checklist (completed)

### Analysis & Reference (Historical)
- **INCOMPLETE_TASKS_ANALYSIS.md** - Analysis of incomplete tasks (historical)
- **OLD_CODEBASE_REFERENCE_MAP.md** - Reference map to old codebase
- **SKILL_UPDATE_DOCS.md** - Agent skill for updating docs (superseded by DOCS_INDEX.md)

## Why Archived?

These documents served their purpose during implementation. The project is now in a maintenance/refactoring phase, so:

1. **Completed checklists** are no longer needed for daily work
2. **Bug fix documentation** is historical (bugs are fixed)
3. **UI documentation** is complete and implemented
4. **Reference materials** are superseded by current docs

## Current Active Documentation

See **`../DOCS_INDEX.md`** in the repo root for:
- Active product requirements
- Current architecture
- Active work (CODE_QUALITY_REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md)
- Configuration and deployment docs
