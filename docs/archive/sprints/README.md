# Sprints Archive

**Note**: Completed sprint records have been moved to `../historical/sprint-records/` for better organization.

## Historical Sprint Records

Completed sprint documentation is located in **[../historical/sprint-records/](../historical/sprint-records/)**:

## Archive Process

When a sprint is completed:
1. System Architect archives sprint documents to `docs/archive/historical/sprint-records/sprint-[N]/`
2. All sprint-specific documents are moved from root and task directories
3. A README.md is created in the sprint directory documenting the archive
